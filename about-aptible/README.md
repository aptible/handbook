# About Aptible

Aptible has always operated with an extremely lean team. At the beginning of 2021 we had just five members of our team focused on Deploy, what we now know as Aptible. We're finishing the year as a team of 16, which is the largest team we've ever had focused on this product.

Our customer retention has always been high, thanks to the ease of use of the product, the good faith of our customers and our stellar Support Team. We will always continue to focus on providing an excellent experience for our existing customers, but we are also finally investing in expanding our outreach and growing our customer base.

Though we've been able to operate with such a lean team for so long, our first focus is making sure we have the right team in place to achieve our next phase of growth. This handbook is an opportunity to not only help prospective team members learn about Aptible but also to ensure new team members can hit the ground running once they join. This will be especially important as we pursue our ambitious [Mission & Strategy](/mission-strategy.md).
