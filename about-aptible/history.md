# Aptible History

Aptible was founded in 2013 by Chas Ballew and Frank Macreery. By 2014, Aptible had achieved strong product-market fit for its infrastructure platform as a service. Over time, this platform as a service was branded many different names, but most customers know it simply as "Aptible."

In 2018, Aptible raised a Series A (announced in 2019) from Maveric Ventures and Thrive Capital. At the time, the team and the investors agreed that Aptible should pursue a two-product strategy, and use the new funding to support investment in a nascent GRC platform called "Aptible Comply" (and previously known as Gridiron). 

Though Aptible Comply had achieved early traction, true product-market fit proved elusive. Despite focusing most investment in the Comply business, the customer and revenue base for Aptible's core platform as a service grew significantly.

In late 2021, Aptible spun out the aspects of Comply that were working best into a separate company [Conveyor](https://www.conveyor.com). Chas left Aptible to become the founder of Conveyor, but remains on the Aptible board of directors. The core Aptible team remains focused on its original platform as a service, and is working to extend Aptible's value proposition to additional cloud infrastructure providers, in addition to its proprietary platform as a service, per our [Mission and Strategy](/mission-strategy.md).
