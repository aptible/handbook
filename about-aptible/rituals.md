# Aptible Rituals
## Planning
As a remote team, setting clear plans and executing against them is critical. We follow a quarterly [goal-setting process](/how-we-work/goal-setting.md) to try to get to the level of clarity and focus we need to successfully execute.

### Sprints
Aptible works in 2 and 3 week sprints. Sprints have a cadence as well as a number of associated meetings, beginning with Planning and culminating in a Retro.

See [Sprint & Project Management](/how-we-work/sprint-project-management) for more on our Sprint process.

## Regular Team Meetings
|	Meetings 	 	|	Frequency			|	Purpose													|
|	---				|	---					|	---														|
|	All Hands		|	Every 2 weeks		|	There are three main agenda items for company all hands:<br />1. Review company strategy/OKRs, and discuss progress towards those OKRs.<br />2. Show-and-tell of completed sprint Epics/progress<br />3. Welcoming new team members!													|
|	Retro			|	After each sprint	|	2 days after the end of each sprint, we take 45-60 minutes to review _how_ the sprint went and whether we should adjust anything aobut how we are working together.														|
|	1:1s			|	Every 1-2 weeks		|	Managers use 1:1s as an opportunity to sync with their direct reports on important issues related to work. Though itâ€™s easy to focus on the minutiae of everyday work, the goal of 1:1s is to create protected space for managers and direct reports to share feedback and concerns, focus on personal development, brainstorm, and set new goals. 1:1s should happen no less than once every two weeks, and should be for approximately 30 Minutes each week (or 60 Minutes every other week). The direct report should own the agenda.														|
|	Happy Hour 	 	|	Every 2 weeks and ad hoc			|	On weeks we do not have an all hands, generally mid-sprint, and ad hoc, we take 45-60 minutes to meet as a team on Zoom (usually over a coffee or beer) for casual conversation or games (we've done trivia and murder mystery)													|
|	Onsite 	 	|	1-2x/year as a company<br />More frequently for individual teams			|	When global pandemics aren't a concern, the team meets all together at least once per year, usually in an interesting location. We use this as an opportunity to connect, work together on meaty topics such as strategic or values-based discussions, and spend some time "away from the desk" by eating at great restaurants and going seeing great sights. Our last Onsite was in Summer 2021 in San Diego, just before Delta became a concern.													|
