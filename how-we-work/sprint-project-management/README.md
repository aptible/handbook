# Sprint and Project Management

Aptible is a remote organization, and much of our work occurs asynchronously. Working remotely and asynchronously poses some challenges. We use our Sprint and Project Management processes to help counteract many these challenges.

## Why Aptible "does" Project Management
Aptible will never build onerous or rigid sprint and project processes--it’s just not in our DNA. But, we have designed our **Aptible Sprint and Project Management (“ASPM”)** processes to help us realize some key benefits:

| Challenge | ASPM Benefit |
| Hard to see how my work fits in with broader company goals | Create alignment by clearly connecting individual units of work (Stories) with company strategic goals (Milestones) through Epics |
| Hard to know what everyone else is working on | Drive clarity by enforcing a Sprint structure and Sprint-planning process where we clearly lay out the Stories that will be completed within a Sprint, and keep those Stories up to date |
| Easy to get distracted by new ideas or initiatives | Enforce focus by ensuring all work is clearly documented in our project management system rather than via Slack conversations/threads |
| Hard to know who is doing what or if we are succeeding or failing | Promote accountability by assigning Epics and Stories to teams and individuals, and setting reasonable deadlines |
| Wasting time by forgetting or re-litigating already-made decisions | Documentation in the form of clear descriptions on Milestones, Epics, and Stories that is referenceable by all team members--nothing of consequence should be only findable by searching Slack |

Beyond this, it never feels good to be unclear what is expected of you, or what you can expect your teammates to deliver. Poor project management is stressful: it makes for a less pleasing and more difficult work environment, and makes it less likely that we will achieve our mission or strategic goals.
