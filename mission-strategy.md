# Aptible Mission & Strategy

## Background
Our proprietary Platform as a Service has helped hundreds of companies pass customer and compliance audits. Our PaaS hosts applications and databases for our customers, ensuring that infrastructure-level security controls are met and maintained at all times. We expect our PaaS will continue to be an excellent option for many companies to easily gain the confidence of deploying secure infrastructure. 

But, it's undeniable the pace of change occurring within cloud infrastructure. The list of capabilities of the big public infrastructure providers (like AWS, GCP, Azure, and even more focused offerings like MongoDB Atlas) continues to expand, with ever-new ways to manage cloud applications and databases. AWS alone has more than _200_ services hosted in 80+ Availability Zones.

With this backdrop, we recognize a significant opportunity for Aptible: in order to have the maximum impact, we must meet developers where they are by helping them to secure the cloud resources they select for a particular job, regardless of which cloud infrastructure provider.


## Mission
Aptible helps developers do their best work by empowering them to use any cloud infrastructure securely.

## Strategy
We intend to deliver the best way for developers to provision, monitor, and test any resource in any cloud environment to ensure their infrastructure always meets regorous security and compliance requirements.

## What does this mean?

However, public infrastructure providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, as well as focused players such as MongoDB Atlas) rapidly expand the list of cloud resources provided to developers. This ever-expanding list of cloud infrastructure services provide an ever-improving 

, we recognize that by only securing o. AWS Aurora might be the best available relational data store, while Google BigQuery or Snowflake might provide the best data warehouse capabilities. 

This proliferation of tools is in many respects excellent for developers. However, securing an ever-expanding list of resources is a challenging task for most companies, and in some cases 

Aptible is aiming to make it easy to provision resources in such a way that monitoring and testing of security controls should largely be abstracted away.
