# Aptible Newptible (New Hire) Budget
Welcome to Aptible! Your Onboarding Checklist and 30/60/90 Day Plan should get you all set to contribute, but we also want to make sure that your workspace is set up to help you succeed. We offer each employee a Newptible Budget of $1,700 USD total towards anything you need to make your workspace your own, whether that’s at home or a local co-working space.

## Co-Working Space
Please note that, in light of COVID-19, this budget is currently on pause as we ask all employees to WFH until further notice.

## Equipment

### Hardware
Prior to your start at Aptible, our team will reach out to you about shipping an Aptible MacBook to your home. If needed for your role, iPhone Service can also be provided via Aptible’s AT&T Plan if you are based in the U.S., and service is reimbursable if you work internationally.

### Accessories
We know that everyone likes to use different tools to optimize their workspace, so we don’t have rules around which specific items you can select. Instead, we ask that your selections are items you need and mainly use for work.

We want you to feel comfortable getting what you need and simply ask that you spend Aptible’s money as if it were your own.

### How to use the budget
As part of your onboarding, you will receive an invitation to use Divvy, our virtual company credit card tool. Through Divvy, you will be assigned a virtual $1,700 USD credit card to use at any online merchant. Once you’re ready to make your purchase(s):
1. Accept your email invitation to use Divvy.
2. On the left-hand toolbar, click the “Cards” icon to view your Newptible credit card. By selecting your card, you can reveal the 16-digit card number as well as billing info for your online purchases. You can also easily copy the card information to use for your purchase.
3. Proceed with your online shopping, with your payment method and billing address set to the credit card information provided in Divvy.
4. Once your purchase is made and payment has been processed, click “Transactions” in the Divvy left-hand toolbar to view your purchases. This may take just a few minutes after your transaction to appear.
5. For each transaction, attach your detailed invoice by scrolling down in the transaction details right-hand panel, and uploading your files under the “Receipts” field.

Your Newptible Budget and associated credit card will expire 3 months after your start date. At this time, only online merchants are eligible for purchasing under this budget.

### Leaving Aptible
Wondering what happens to all of this great stuff once your time at Aptible has come to an end, which is hopefully a long time from now?
- **Hardware**: We will ask you to return your Aptible MacBook, iPhone and YubiKeys to us, either by mail or in-person.
- **Accessories**: You are welcome to keep any of the other accessories purchased under the Newptible Budget policy.

## A Final Note
We want everyone to be in a comfortable and productive work environment. Each team member’s work situation is different and we know this policy may not answer every question. If there’s something that will enhance your day-to-day experience that is not addressed above, simply reach out to your Manager or #operations in Slack so we can discuss!
