# Laptop Procurement

## Who is eligible to order a new laptop
* New Team Members (we'll order or ship your hardware as soon as there is an accepted offer by a candidate)
* Employees with machines that are 3+ years old. Talk to your manager or People Ops / IT (currently: Taylor & Yujie)
* Employees whose laptops are not functioning sufficiently due to accidental damage or some other performance issue. Talk to your manager

## Laptop ordering process
* People Ops / IT (currently: Taylor & Yujie) order laptops as soon as there is an accepted offer -or- an eligible employee has requested a new laptop
* All orders are fulfilled through the [Apple ecommerece store](http://ecommerce.apple.com)
* If we anticipate shipping delays, we may pre-order machines in advance of offers being accepted
* If an existing machine is being refreshed, the employee is responsible for appropriate disposal of the old machine

## Laptop configurations
For many reasons, especially security-related, we strongly encourage team members to use Apple hardware. By default, we will provide all team members with Apple laptops.

In general, we provide the latest hardware upgraded, within reason, for all employees. Screen size depends on availability and role.

Some examples of laptop configurations are:

* Technical / designer / engineer - Macbook Pro 14-16" M1 Max / 10 core CPU / 16-32 core GPU / 512GB RAM
* Non-technical roles - Macbook Pro 14" M1 Max / 10 core CPU / 16-32 core GPU / 512GB RAM

While we may provide used hardware for employees, we will not provide legacy (3+ year old hardware) and we seek to establish the above as our target configurations for all employees.

Our expectation is that, with the exception of screen size, the performance difference between these M1 Max machines will be negligible for most and possibly all employees. As a result, given that shipping delays have become extreme, we will choose specific specifications based on availability. If you need a large screen size for your work, but we are unable to procure 16" machines for you (or even if we are), we'll ensure you have a desktop monitor to supplement your machine.

If you feel strongly that you'd like a particular set of specifications, or something all together different from the above (e.g. a smaller machine for more portability), please discuss with your hiring manager. We will seek to accommodate specific requests, but shipping estimates and availability will dictate our ability to fulfill.

## Laptop Repair
Employees can take laptops to any Apple store if repair is needed. If repair time is long (1+ days), please try to coordinate repairs with People Ops / IT so that we can provide a loaner laptop.

## Laptop Refresh
* Employees are eligible to request a new laptop once their laptop reaches 3 years of use, regardless of the employee's tenure.
* When refreshing a 3+ year old laptop, employees can choose to Donate or Buyback their machine.

## Laptop Disposal
If an employee is replacing their machine or is offboarding from Aptible, the employee is responsible for ensuring appropriate laptop disposal. All laptops will be wiped as part of the disposal process.

The disposal options are:

1. Donation
2. Buy back
3. Return to Aptible

### Donation
When employees are refreshing functional laptops that are greater than 3 years old, we strongly encourage donation to an acceptable partner charity. We will be working to create partnerships with appropriate charities.

Donation must be planned and approved by People Ops / IT (currently: Taylor & Yujie) All laptops will be wiped

### Laptop buyback
#### Offboarding
* For employees offboarding from Aptible with less than 1 year of tenure, the laptop must be returned to Aptible -or- purchased at then current market value. Employees will receive details about purchasing or returning laptops as part of their employment termination agreement. All laptops will be wiped
* For employees offboarding from Aptible with greater than 1 year of tenure, the employee can opt to keep the laptop at no cost. Employees will receive details about keeping or returning laptops as part of their employment termination agreement. All laptops will be wiped
* For employees with greater than 1 year of tenure who are refreshing their laptop because it is greater than 3 years old, the employee can opt to keep the laptop at no cost. All laptops will be wiped

### Returning to Aptible
There are two cases when you will need to return your laptop to Aptible:
* The laptop is usable but you are refreshing it for some approved reason
* You are offboarding with less than 1 year of tenure and you opt out of purchasing the machine at the prevailing market price
