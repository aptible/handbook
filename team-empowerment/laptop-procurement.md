# Laptop Procurement

## Who is eligible to order a new laptop
* New Team Members (we'll order or ship your hardware as soon as there is an accepted offer by a candidate)
* Employees with machines that are 3+ years old. Talk to your manager or People Ops / IT (currently: Taylor & Yujie)
* Employees whose laptops are not functioning sufficiently due to accidental damage or some other performance issue. Talk to your manager

## Laptop ordering process
* People Ops / IT (currently: Taylor & Yujie) order laptops as soon as there is an accepted offer -or- an eligible employee has requested a new laptop
* All orders are fulfilled through the [Apple Business Store](http://ecommerce.apple.com)
* If we anticipate shipping delays, we may pre-order machines in advance of offers being accepted
* If an existing machine is being refreshed, the employee is responsible for appropriate disposal of the old machine as [outlined below](#laptop-disposal)

## Laptop configurations
For many reasons, especially security-related, we strongly encourage team members to use Apple hardware. By default, all team members are provided Apple laptops.

In general, we provide all employees with the latest hardware within reason. Screen size depends on availability and role.

Some examples of laptop configurations are:

* Technical / designer / engineer roles:
 - MacBook Pro 14-16" M1 Pro-Max / 10-core CPU / 16-32-core GPU / 32GB RAM / 512GB SSD
* Non-technical roles:
 - MacBook Pro 14" M1 Pro / 10-core CPU / 14-core GPU / 16 GB RAM / 512GB SSD

While in some cases we may provide used hardware for employees, we will not provide legacy (3+ year old hardware) and we seek to establish the above as our target configurations for all employees.

Our expectation is that any difference in performance between various configurations of the new M1 machines will be negligible for most and possibly all employees. As a result, given that shipping delays have become extreme, we may in some cases strategically select different configurations based on availability. If you feel that you need a particular confugiration, or something altogether different, please discuss with your hiring manager as early as possible noting that availability and shipping estimates will need to be considered in conjunction with your planned start date.

Regardless of laptop screen size, all employees are eligible to purchase a desktop monitor under the Newptible Budget. If you have any questions or concerns reach out to your Manager or raise in #operations in Slack for discussion.

## Laptop Repair
Employees can take laptops to any Apple store if repair is needed. If repair time is long (1+ days), please try to coordinate repairs with People Ops / IT so that we can provide a loaner laptop.

## Laptop Refresh
* Employees are eligible to request a new laptop once their laptop reaches 3 years of use, regardless of the employee's tenure.
* When refreshing a 3+ year old laptop, employees can choose to donate or keep the laptop at no cost. Employees must coordinate with People Ops / IT (currently: Taylor & Yujie) to wipe the laptop. All laptops must be wiped prior to donating or keeping.

## Laptop Disposal
If an employee is replacing their machine or is offboarding from Aptible, the employee is responsible for ensuring appropriate laptop disposal in coordination with People Ops / IT (currently: Taylor & Yujie) to wipe the laptop. All laptops must be wiped prior to disposal. There are three disposal options:

**Donate**: When employees are refreshing functional laptops that are 3+ years old, we strongly encourage donation to an acceptable partner charity. We will be working to create partnerships with appropriate charities. Donation must be planned and approved by People Ops / IT (currently: Taylor & Yujie). All laptops must be wiped prior to donating.

**Buy back**: If an employee is offboarding with less than 1 year of tenure, the employee may elect to purchase the laptop at the current market value. Details will be provided as part of the employment termination process. All laptops must be wiped prior to purchase.

**Return to Aptible**: If an employee is offboarding with less than 1 year of tenure and elects not to purchase the laptop -or- the employee has special approval to refresh a laptop that is still usable or less than 3 years old, the laptop must be returned to Aptible. Details and an easy-to-pack padded box and prepaid shipping label will be provided for laptop returns. All laptops must be wiped prior to returning to Aptible.

### Options When Offboarding
* Employees offboarding with <1 year of tenure:
  - The laptop must be returned to Aptible -or- purchased at the current market value. Details will be provided to you as part of the employment termination process. All laptops must be wiped prior to purchase or return.
* Employees offboarding with >1 year of tenure:
  - The employee can opt to donate or keep the laptop at no cost. Details will be provided to you as part of the employment termination process. All laptops must be wiped prior to donating or keeping.
