# Onboarding at Aptible

# Quickstart Guide

Welcome to Aptible! We are so excited you're here.

We created this guide with the intent to organize onboarding around a central launchpad. This Quickstart Guide will cover all of the basics for incoming team members including systems setup and getting up to speed on our strategy as well as an overview of your first few weeks at Aptible. As a supplement to this guide, certain roles also have role-specific guides, more on that under [Role-Specific Guides](#role-specific-guides).

## Initial Setup
In order to get started you'll need to have two things on-hand: your Aptible Macbook and an invitation to Okta which we use for access management (this should be in your personal inbox on or before your first day). Once your laptop has shipped, you will receive an email from our Operations team with tracking information as well as the Aptible New Hire Setup Guide which covers initial setup steps and a high-level overview of the onboarding process.

Once Okta is set up you will be able to access your Aptible Gmail inbox where you will find other resources such as your personalized Onboarding Checklist, calendar invites to meet with members of the team, and invitations to access other systems including the below.

As soon as your laptop is set up and you have access to your Aptible inbox, locate the invitation from Jamf to enroll your laptop in device management per [Day 1](#day-1) requirements below.

## Primary Slack Channels
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all Slack channels as there are a number of #auto- channels, channels created temporarily for sprints/projects, private channels, etc. however this list covers the "staple" channels all team members should expect to be in or have access to.

## Your First Few Weeks
##### By End of Day 1
There are a handful of key tasks which must be completed by your first day at Aptible:
* As soon as your laptop is set up and you have access to your Aptible inbox, locate the invitation from Jamf to enroll your laptop in device management. Restart your laptop for Jamf to enable FileVault and other managed settings.

* Download [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/download.html) for network monitoring, locate the license key in your personalized Onboarding Checklist G Sheet to activate, and send a screenshot of Little Snitch running to itops@aptible.com.

* (If U.S. Based) In TriNet, complete payroll and benefits setup, read and sign the TriNet employee handbook and complete Section 1 of USCIS Form I-9. I-9 Section 2 (verification of identity and authorization to work) will be completed live with People Ops (currently: Taylor & Yujie) generally on your first day but no later than your 3rd day in accordance with USCIS requirements.

##### By End of Week 1
Our shared goal is to complete all action items in your Onboarding Checklist by the end of your first week at Aptible unless otherwise noted. Beyond your Onboarding Checklist, there are a few other tasks to work through during your first week, outlined here.
* Meet with your manager to discuss your initial projects and areas of focus and/or your 30/60/90 plan. Create your first story in Shortcut from your projects or areas of focus.

* Watch 1-2 recent All Hands calls (command + F search "All Hands" in [Gong](https://app.gong.io/home?workspace-id=2632804425585962651)). Decks are linked out from the event details of the bi-weekly recurring event in Google Calendar.

* Watch the current product overview and new Anycloud product demo to familarize with the current state and future vision of Aptible.

* Watch 1-2 recent customer discovery calls

* Poke around Redash (requires IP allowlisting per Onboarding Checklist) to familiarize yourself with metrics, finances and more. Our [KPI](https://redash.aptiblehq.com/dashboards/26-kpi-acquisition-and-retention), [PLG Funnel](https://redash.aptiblehq.com/dashboards/20-plg-funnel?p_Date%20Range=d_last_90_days&p_w125_Date%20Range=d_last_90_days&p_w128_Date%20Range=d_last_90_days), and [MRR, ARPA & Churn Overview](https://redash.aptiblehq.com/dashboards/15-mrr-arpa-and-churn-overview) dashboards are a great place to start.

* Watch the [Finance Brownbag](https://app.gong.io/call?id=4549731811283619078) to learn more about how Aptible operates from a financial standpoint.

##### By End of Week 2
* Get ready for your AMA (to occur during your first or second company-wide meeting, dependent on timing of your start date). There's no need to formally prepare however People Ops (currently: Taylor & Yujie) will share a few questions with you (and sometimes a request for images) ahead of time so you can give them some thought. We've found it fun to share images with the team to enhance interactivity or when possible, get the team to guess your responses,

* Familiarize yourself with [Aptible Handbook](https://www.aptible.com/handbook/) and provide feedback to help us improve or better yet, submit a PR for suggested improvements directly!

* Meet with 2-3 new coworkers outside of your direct team. Suggestions include our CEO, Frank Macreery, our COO, Henry Hund, a member of Operations if you're an engineer, an engineer if you're a member of Customer Success, etc.

##### By End of Week 3
* Complete your first Shortcut story (may not necessarily be the first story you created)

* (Temporarily on hold as we work to revamp the materials) Participate in Aptible 101 and Aptible 102, presentations led by members of the team designed to increase engagement, familiarize you with our history as a company, introduce you to our strategy and more.
