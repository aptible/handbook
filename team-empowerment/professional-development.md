# Aptible Professional Development Budget

We are a team of learners. At Aptible, we care deeply about fostering an environment where you’re challenged to grow and given opportunities to deepen your understanding of our industry and your area of expertise. To this end, we offer each employee an Annual Professional Development Budget of $3,000 USD to use towards experiences that improve you professionally and inform your work at 	Aptible.

Examples of how one might use their Professional Development Budget include:
- Participation in a Training/Workshop (e.g. Reforge, IDEO University — Storytelling, etc.)
- Attendance at a Conference (e.g. RailsConf, JSConf, AWS re:Invent, etc.)

In the spirit of _Teaching as Learning_, we encourage everyone who uses their Professional Development Budget to bring their knowledge back to Aptible by sharing it openly with colleagues — whether by writing documentation, delivering a presentation, or crafting a blog post about your experience, for example.

### How to use the budget
1. Discuss with your Manager and secure their approval of the use case(s) you have in mind. Programs that exceed the budget can be considered on a case-by-case basis. If you have received approval for an expense exceeding $3,000, please notify Finance (Yujie) to increase your Divvy credit card limit.
2. Accept your invitation to Divvy (if you haven’t already done so) and log in to view your virtual card under the Professional Development budget to pay for the expense. Refer to the below articles on how to use Divvy:

3. Following the instructions per the Confluence articles linked above, attach your invoice and receipt (proof of purchase) to the transaction in Divvy.

## Books
We have an open policy with regards to ordering books under $100 USD that are relevant to your work at Aptible. We simply ask that you spend Aptible’s money as if it were your own, and do what’s in the best interest of the company.
