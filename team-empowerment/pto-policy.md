# Aptible Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy
At Aptible, we are excited to offer an **Open Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy**. This means that we do not have an accrual or tenure-based system, in favor of maximizing freedom and flexibility. We believe that every member of the Aptible Team should feel fully empowered to take the time they need to care for themselves, their families, and the things that are most important to them. We also know that studies have tied taking PTO to increased open communication and learning on teams[^1], improvements in creativity and product quality[^2], and a higher likelihood of professional growth[^3].

The United States is the only country within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)[^4] that doesn’t guarantee paid time off for employees[^5]. Even when paid time off is offered by employers, it is vastly underutilized. 55% of US employees are not using all of the time off available to them and, since 2000, we have seen an unprecedented decline in PTO usage by US employees. In 2018, Americans took 14% fewer days off than the average number of days taken off between 1978 and 2000[^6].

Please note that we see this policy as a starting point and plan to re-evaluate this policy yearly, within the context of the resources we have and the pressures we face as a company to succeed in our market environment.

Should you have any feedback or questions about this policy, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the Leadership Team. We’re here with open ears and open doors.

### Communication
- **Company Holidays:** It is _not_ necessary to create an OOO Event in your calendar or PTO tool.
- **Non-Company Holidays:** Please let your Manager know as soon as possible. Please submit your PTO request in the [Aptible PTO Scheduler](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePXcBQzLV1Vk9dGwSYLUvP3x2rExZr8eQ4wflMPUiTCj-etQ/viewform). Once done, create the OOO Event via your Google Calendar (and Aptible’s PTO Calendar), and select “Holiday — Other than Company Holiday” (Short-Term Leave).
## Requesting, Tracking, and Preparing for PTO
### PTO Tracker
We use a [PTO Tool](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePXcBQzLV1Vk9dGwSYLUvP3x2rExZr8eQ4wflMPUiTCj-etQ/viewform) to help us communicate clearly about and prepare for time out of the office.
- [First Time Users] 
    - Please ensure ‘Aptible PTO’ is on your list of Google Calendars (if not, please let us know in #operations)
- [All Users]
    - Submit PTO by filling out the form in the [Aptible PTO Scheduler](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePXcBQzLV1Vk9dGwSYLUvP3x2rExZr8eQ4wflMPUiTCj-etQ/viewform). This will notify your manager and submit the request for their approval.
    - Once you’ve filled out the form, create an out of office in the Aptible PTO calendar for the days you will be away, labeled “[NAME] OOO”.
    - We also strongly encourage you to create out of office events in your own Aptible Google Calendar to ensure meetings are automatically declined and your slack status is updated on the days you are away.
### Gmail Autoresponders
Please update your Gmail to send out an autoresponder during the time you are OOO. You can find a handful of OOO templates [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/seven-examples-professional-out-office-autoresponder-email-ramadoss/).
### Types of Leave
#### Vacation 
We believe that taking real, planned vacations is important — Aptible's long-term goals are aligned with your well-being. The results you produce are more important to us than the hours you spend at your desk.
- **Length:** We ask that you make plans while considering upcoming due dates, project work, and load balancing on your team. Ultimately, we encourage you to take the time you need and trust your judgment.
- **Communication:** Please let your Manager know about your plans as far in advance as possible, especially if you plan to be out for 1+ Weeks. Please submit the request in the PTO Scheduler and select “Vacation” in the drop-down menu.
#### Personal Leave
We understand that we’ll all need to take time off for matters of personal importance. For example, employees at Aptible have taken Personal Days to tend to their mental health, care for a loved one, move apartments, etc.
- **Length:** Personal Leave is discretionary. We encourage you to take the time you need.
- **Communication:** Please let your Manager know as soon as you are able. As with all PTO, please submit the request in the PTO Scheduler and select “Personal Leave” in the drop-down menu.
#### Sick Leave
##### Short-Term Sick Leave
At Aptible, we praise focus, seek leverage, and plan our work to make the biggest impact with the least amount of precious time. _Health is leverage._ It will take years to reach our most ambitious goals, so we aim to perform at a high level over a long period of time.

- **Length:** Sick Leave is discretionary[^7]. We encourage you to take the time you need to recuperate, and to return to work feeling well and fully present.
- **Communication:** Please let your Manager know as soon as you are able. As with all PTO, please submit the request in the PTO Scheduler and select “Sick Leave” in the drop-down menu.
[^7]:Federal Law 
    - [Fair Labor and Standards Act (FLSA)](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/vacation_leave): Federal law does not require that employers provide any type of paid leave, including paid Sick Leave.
    - [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/): In some instances, employers are required to provide up to 12 Weeks of Unpaid Leave. (NB: As of December 2019, Aptible employees are ineligible for FMLA Leave).
    
    State Law
    - 12 States and Washington D.C. currently mandate employer-provided Sick Leave.  As of November 2019, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington D.C. require Paid Sick Leave. 
    - This policy supplements any State Level policies. Sick Leave runs concurrently with, and will be applied to, any qualifying State policies to the extent consistent with applicable law. Please contact the People Operations Team for more information.
##### Extended Sick Leave[^8]
If you have a serious health condition that impedes your ability to perform your job, please let your Manager know as soon as possible, so we can develop a plan to support you.

##### Caring for Family Leave
If you need to care for a loved one with a serious health condition, please let your Manager know as soon as possible, so we can develop a plan to support you.

At Aptible, we are excited to offer Paid Parental Leave of 14 Weeks at 100% Base Pay. We believe that every member of the Aptible Team deserves fulfilling work and close family ties — and that you should feel fully empowered to take care of your family and yourself. See the [Aptible Parental Leave Policy](https://drive.google.com/a/aptible.com/open?id=1ThEGVMrq-gJN_7WS6tqrZiUgQw1uhNHeaZsf9G3ZK2o) for more details.
